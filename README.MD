## Installation

If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

1. Download or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/Tea505/9384-CenterStage.git`.

2. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

3. If you have trouble with multidex, enable proguard by changing `useProguard` to `true` in `build.common.gradle`.

## Getting Started

If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Blocks-Tutorial), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/OnBot-Java-Tutorial) or to [Android Studio](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/wiki/Android-Studio-Tutorial) afterwards.
